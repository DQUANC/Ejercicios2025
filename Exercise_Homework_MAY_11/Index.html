<h1>🏎️ The Formula 1 </h1>

<p>Formula One (F1) is the highest class of international racing for open-wheel, single-seater formula racing cars. 
    It is a championship series sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and is considered the 
    pinnacle of motorsport. The term "formula" refers to the set of rules that all participating cars must adhere to. </p>

<h3> The championships </h3>
<p> Two major championships are contested: the Drivers' Championship (for the individual with the most points at the end of the season)
     and the Constructors' Championship (for the team with the most combined points). </p>

<h3> Whats the F1 Sprint? </h3>
<p> The F1 Sprint is a short race. It covers 100km – about one-third of a typical Grand Prix distance – and should last about 30 minutes. 
    This length has been chosen to encourage a race that is dynamic rather than strategic, with no mandatory pit stop.

While the bulk of the Formula 1 season consists of traditional Grand Prix weekends as we’ve covered above, six of them – 
a quarter of the 24 events in total – have been designated F1 Sprint events, which add another layer of excitement to proceedings.

A Sprint weekend is still a three-day affair with the Grand Prix as the main event, but the Sprint Qualifying session 
(which sets the grid for the Sprint) replaces FP2 on Friday afternoon. The Sprint itself takes place on Saturday (instead of FP3), 
before Qualifying for the Grand Prix happens as normal. </p>
