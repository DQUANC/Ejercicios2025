        The Web Development
    </h1>

    <h2 class="center">
        Introduction to Web Development
    </h2>
    <p class="colorSky">
        Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites or web applications that run in a browser. It encompasses everything from creating simple static pages to complex, interactive platforms. Developers typically work with languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to structure and style content, while also using frameworks and libraries to enhance functionality and user experience.

        Frontend vs Backend Development
    </h2>
    <p class="colorGreen">
        Web development is generally divided into two main areas: frontend and backend. <br>
        The frontend is what users interact with directly â€” it's all about visuals and user interface, often built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React or Angular. <br>
        The backend, on the other hand, handles data, servers, and business logic. It's built using languages like Node.js, Python, Java, or PHP, and often works with databases like MySQL or MongoDB.
    </p>

        Responsive Design and Accessibility
    </h2>
    <p class="colorBrown">
        Modern web development places a strong emphasis on responsive design and accessibility. <br>
        Responsive design ensures that websites work well on all devices, from phones to desktops, by using flexible layouts and media queries. <br>
        Accessibility focuses on making websites usable for everyone, including people with disabilities. This involves using semantic HTML, providing alt text for images, and ensuring proper keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

        The Importance of Web Performance and SEO 
    </h2>
    <p class="colorYellow">
        A well-developed website needs to load quickly and be optimized for search engines. <br>
        Web performance affects user experience and directly impacts metrics like bounce rate and conversion. <br>
        Developers use tools like caching, image optimization, and code minification to speed up loading times. <br>
        SEO (Search Engine Optimization) involves structuring content and metadata in ways that help search engines understand and rank the site effectively, making it easier for users to discover.
